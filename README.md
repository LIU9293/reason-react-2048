## Motivation
As a frontend developer using React for two years, I use JavaScript and React everyday: dive into new packages, fork and change some libraries, struggle with babel and webpack... But how can I get further, and become a good programmer I satisfied, maybe I need to get out of my comfort zone and do something really hard for me, like: A new language.

## Why Reason
I get to know reason because watched some speaks on YouTube by ChenLou, a really nice programmer in Facebook who built React-Motion. It looks like they describe ReasonReact as **The future of React**. So, I think it's good for me, who has few experience on language beside JavaScript but familiar with React itself.

## Roadmap
Let's start from [here](https://github.com/LIU9293/reason-react-2048/blob/master/roadmap/day1.md)!
